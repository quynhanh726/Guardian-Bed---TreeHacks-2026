# Guardian Bed

**AI-Powered Continuous Patient Monitoring System**

Guardian Bed is a full-stack healthcare system that transforms patient care from **reactive monitoring → proactive intervention**. By integrating multimodal sensors, AI models, and secure infrastructure, the system continuously tracks patient conditions across both hospital and home environments.

---

## Overview

Healthcare systems today rely on **intermittent monitoring**, leaving critical gaps where complications go undetected.

Guardian Bed solves this by enabling:

* Continuous real-time monitoring
* Intelligent patient prioritization
* Early detection of deterioration
* Prevention of pressure ulcers and hospital readmissions

---

## Key Features

### Multimodal Monitoring

* Pressure mat (ulcer risk detection)
* Wearable wristband (HR, HRV, motion)
* Temperature sensors (inflammation detection)
* mmWave radar (contactless movement & breathing)
* Voice AI agent (clinical conversation tracking)

---

### Intelligent Prioritization

The system computes a unified risk score:

```math
R_{\text{total}} = \alpha R_{\text{ulcer}} + \beta R_{\text{health}}
```

Where:

```math
R_{\text{ulcer}} = f(\text{pressure}, \text{time}, \text{temperature})
```

```math
R_{\text{health}} = f(\text{HR}, \text{HRV}, \text{movement}, \text{temperature})
```

Patients are ranked in real-time:

```math
\text{Priority Score} = (1 - R_{\text{total}}) + \text{Immobility} + \text{Urgency}
```

---

### Voice AI Clinical Agent

* Converts speech → structured notes
* Tracks medication timing and symptoms
* Enables cross-shift communication for nurses

---

### Continuous Monitoring Beyond Hospital

* Deployable in both hospital and home
* Supports critical **30-day post-surgery recovery window**
* Reduces preventable readmissions

---

### Quantum-Safe Security

```math
\text{Secure System} = \text{BB84} + \text{Kyber-768}
```

Ensures future-proof protection against quantum attacks.

---

## Impact

Guardian Bed addresses three major healthcare problems:

### 1. Post-Surgery Complications

```math
\text{Early Detection} \rightarrow \text{Timely Intervention} \rightarrow \text{Better Outcomes}
```

---

### 2. Hospital Readmissions

```math
\text{Continuous Monitoring} \rightarrow \text{Fewer Readmissions}
```

* Targets preventable readmissions (~27–40%)
* Reduces $50B+ annual burden

---

### 3. Pressure Ulcers

```math
\text{Pressure + Time + Temperature} \rightarrow \text{Ulcer Risk}
```

* Detects prolonged pressure early
* Prevents tissue damage
